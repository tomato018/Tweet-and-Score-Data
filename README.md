# Tweet-and-Score-Data

The data sets in this repository come from a seven week educational data science course. You have access to data from two iterations of this course, one in 2014 and one in 2015. The course content is disaggregated, EG - Students choose the order in which they wish to tackle each unit. You may be familiar with this format ;) Students complete one unit each week for six weeks, in the seventh week all students must sit the same final exam.

## Scores.csv

This data set contains the unit choices, time spent on each unit in minutes and scores for each unit students recieved. It also contains final exam scores. All scores are represented at a proportion of the overall possible score (0 - 1).

## tweets.csv

Permission was recieved from the students in this course to collect their tweets during the course. This data set contains those tweets, the week in which they were tweeted and if the tweet was a reply to another student in the class.**

** These are real Tweets from the wild, collected by the [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/home) team at Stanford. I have attempted to clean them of anything offensive but may have missed something so be aware if you plan on reading the text.
